## 1 Introduction
Welcome to the comprehensive README for the Siamese Network for Face Recognition project. In
this extensive document, we will provide a detailed overview of the project, its objectives, data, model
architecture, training process, evaluation metrics, and practical applications.
## 2 Project Overview
The Siamese Network for Face Recognition project aims to create a robust model capable of recognizing
whether two given facial images belong to the same individual. This task has diverse applications,
including biometric security systems, image clustering, and more.
## 3 Dataset
To initiate the project, the first crucial step is acquiring the LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) dataset,
which you can obtain from this link: http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/.

### 3.1 Data Preprocessing
Organizing the downloaded dataset is essential for effective training. This includes segregating the im-
ages and accompanying annotations. Additionally, we conducted a preliminary analysis to determine
the number of individuals with more than one image.
### 3.2 Data Splitting
We employed a person-based data splitting strategy, creating dedicated sets for training, validation,
and testing. The dataset distribution includes 300 image pairs for training, 75 pairs for validation,
and 100 pairs for testing.
## 4 Model Architecture
Our model is constructed using the MobileNet Small architecture, featuring approximately 2 million
pre-trained weights. This architecture was selected to accommodate our computational resources and
reduce training time.
### 4.1 Image Preprocessing
To conform to the input size expected by the MobileNet Small architecture, we resized the images to
224x224x3. Image preprocessing is a crucial aspect of any deep learning project.
### 4.2 Siamese Network
The heart of our project is a Siamese network, a neural network designed for metric learning. In
our implementation, we used the Euclidean distance as the metric learning scheme to determine the
similarity between image pairs.
#### 4.2.1 Additional Model Steps
For enhanced model performance and robustness, we introduced image augmentation techniques.
Furthermore, we conducted in-depth experiments with various regularization techniques and hyper-
parameters, optimizing the model for the face recognition task.
## 5 Training Process
Our model underwent rigorous training, comprising 30 epochs. Throughout the training phase, we
explored different learning rate schedulers and optimizers to fine-tune the model.
### 5.1 Learning Rate Schedulers
Our experiments included two distinct learning rate schedulers: Cosine Annealing and StepLR. These
investigations allowed us to evaluate their effectiveness in training and performance.
### 5.2 Optimizers
We applied two different optimizers, namely Adam and RMSprop, to optimize the model. The out-
comes and comparative analysis of these optimizers during training are discussed in the project’s
source code and documentation.

## 6 Testing and Evaluation
Following the training phase, we meticulously evaluated our trained model on the test split of the
dataset. Evaluation metrics, accuracy, and insights gained from these tests are presented in the
project’s source code and documentation.
## 7 Personal Images
In addition to the LFW dataset, we gathered a small collection of personal images (with consent) to
assess the model’s performance on custom data. The results from testing the model on this person-
alized dataset and implications for real-world applications are thoroughly explored in the project’s
source code and documentation.
## 8 Applications
The Siamese Network for Face Recognition project offers various practical applications, including but
not limited to:
• Face verification and recognition in security systems
• Facial similarity-based image retrieval
• Improved image clustering
• Identity verification in e-commerce and social media platforms
• Enhanced user experience in augmented reality applications
